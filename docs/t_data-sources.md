## About Data Sources and Data Sets

BIRT reports use a data source element to connect to a database or other data provider. BIRT uses a data set element to retrieve data from the data provider. Think of the data source as a connection, and the data set as a query.

## Build a Data Source

Let's build our data source:

*    Open the Data Explorer View, if it is not already visible.

*    Select the Data Sources node within the tree view.

*    Right-click to open the context menu.

*    Choose New Data Source. The New Data Source dialog appears.

*    Choose Classic Models Inc. Sample Database.

*    In the Data Source Name field, enter "Sample".

*    Click Next.

*    Click Finish.

Your new data source appears within the Data Sources node in the Data Explorer.

## Edit a Data Source

For future reference, let's review how you would go about changing the data source:

*    Find or open the Data Explorer View.

*    Open the Data Sources node.

*    Double-click the data source.

*    The Data Source editor opens. You can make any needed changes.

*    Click OK to save your changes.
