## The Project

BIRT is an open source software project that provides the BIRT technology platform to create data visualizations and reports that can be embedded into rich client and web applications, especially those based on Java. BIRT is a top-level software project within the Eclipse Foundation.

BIRT is supported by an active community of committers, contributers and users here at Eclipse.org. BIRT is also supported by the Open Standard Business Platform Project (OSBP) and its Open Standard Business Application Working Group (OSbea).

The project is sponsored by Compex Systemhaus GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, and **$$$---Win and Scott and ??? ---**. BIRT was origanaly initiated and sponsored by Actuate with contributions from IBM, and Innovent Solutions.  It is licensed under the Eclipse Public License (EPL).

## The Groundswell

Today, BIRT technology platform is one of the most widely
adopted data visualization and reporting technologies with over 12
million downloads and over 2.5M developers across 157 countries. BIRT
also has a large, active and growing developer community representing
all types of organizations. Major technology companies such as IBM,
Cisco, S1 and ABS Nautical Systems as well as Eclipse projects like OSBP have incorporated BIRT into their
product lines.

## The Technology Platform

BIRT has two main components: a visual report designer for
creating BIRT Designs, and a runtime component for generating those
designs that can be deployed to any Java environment. The BIRT project
also includes a charting engine that is both fully integrated into the
BIRT designer and can be used standalone to integrate charts into an
application.

BIRT designs are persisted as XML and can access a number of
different data sources including JDO datastores, JFire Scripting
Objects, POJOs, SQL databases, Web Services and XML.
